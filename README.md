This project outlines a scenario in which an IT employee’s machine is potentially compromised after using a virtual machine (VM) from a compromised Capture the Flag (CTF) site. The incident involves a series of tasks designed to investigate the potential breach by analyzing network traffic and the memory of the compromised machine using tools like **Wireshark**, **Volatility**, and others. Here's a step-by-step approach to completing the incident response investigation.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

---

### **1. Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark**

**Objective:** Analyze the network traffic captured in the provided `pcap` file to understand communication between the compromised machine and the attacker.

**Steps:**
- **Open Wireshark** and load the provided `.pcap` file.
- **Filter the traffic** using the suspected IP addresses:
  - Filter communication between the compromised machine (192.168.248.100) and the malicious IPs (192.168.248.217 and 192.168.248.200) using the filter:  
    ```
    ip.src == 192.168.248.100 && (ip.dst == 192.168.248.217 || ip.dst == 192.168.248.200)
    ```
- **Analyze packet timestamps** to identify the first connection between the victim and the malicious server.  
  In this case, packet 30197 shows that the victim connected to the compromised VM (192.168.248.217).
- **Identify malicious traffic**: Look for unusual connections (e.g., to port 8080 and 4444). These ports are commonly associated with backdoors or control mechanisms like Metasploit reverse shells.
- **Suspicious files**: If you find files being transferred or downloaded (e.g., using HTTP), export the files for further analysis.

### **2. Memory Analysis with Volatility**

**Objective:** Identify and analyze malicious processes running on the compromised machine using memory dump analysis.

**Steps:**
- **Load the memory dump** into **Volatility**.
- **Check for running processes** using the `pslist` or `pstree` plugins:
  ```bash
  volatility -f <memory_dump> pslist
  ```
  - From your investigation, some of the suspicious processes identified were:
    - `ghost.exe`
    - `mXvtj.exe`
    - `HgTg.exe`

- **Identify network connections**: Use the `netscan` plugin to analyze network activity.
  ```bash
  volatility -f <memory_dump> netscan
  ```
  - This revealed connections to malicious IPs and ports (7777, 4444, 9999) associated with the attacker’s IP (192.168.248.200).

- **Malicious files identification**: Use the `filescan` or `malfind` plugins to search for rogue files.
  ```bash
  volatility -f <memory_dump> filescan
  volatility -f <memory_dump> malfind
  ```
  - Export the suspicious files for further analysis using the `procdump` plugin:
    ```bash
    volatility -f <memory_dump> procdump --pid <PID> -D /path/to/export/
    ```

### **3. Analysis of Malicious Files**

**Objective:** Examine the malicious files using tools like **VirusTotal** or other malware analysis tools to identify the exact threat.

**Steps:**
- **Submit the files** extracted from the memory dump (e.g., `ghost.exe`, `HgRgTVSdX.exe`, etc.) to **VirusTotal** or a similar service for detailed analysis.  
  Since these files are associated with attacker-controlled IPs, they are likely involved in maintaining access to the compromised machine.

- **Check for malware signatures**: If VirusTotal or other tools recognize these files, they may provide information on whether these are known malware variants (e.g., Metasploit backdoors).

---

### **4. Privilege Escalation and System Compromise**

**Objective:** Determine the attacker’s level of access and whether they achieved system-level privileges.

**Steps:**
- **Analyze system privileges** using the `getsids` plugin to determine if the attacker has escalated their privileges.
  ```bash
  volatility -f <memory_dump> getsids
  ```
  - If the output shows the presence of high-privileged accounts (e.g., `S-1-5-18`), this indicates the attacker has gained system-level privileges.

- **Identify privilege escalation techniques**: If Metasploit or similar tools were used, this might indicate how the attacker escalated privileges to gain full control of the system.

### **5. Report and Mitigation**

**Objective:** Document findings and suggest mitigation steps.

**Key Findings:**
- **Attacker’s IP**: 192.168.248.200
- **Victim’s machine**: 192.168.248.100
- **Compromised VM hosting malicious site**: 192.168.248.217
- **Malicious processes**: `ghost.exe`, `mXvtj.exe`, `HgTg.exe`
- **Ports involved**: 7777, 4444, 9999
- **Evidence of system-level privileges**: Yes, based on the `getsids` output.

**Recommendations**:
- **Isolate the compromised machine**: Immediately take the affected system offline to prevent further spread or control by the attacker.
- **Patch vulnerabilities**: Ensure that any known vulnerabilities exploited during the attack (e.g., cross-site scripting) are patched.
- **Conduct forensic analysis**: Perform a more thorough analysis to ensure no other machines were compromised via lateral movement.
- **Rebuild the compromised system**: Once analysis is complete, rebuild the system from a clean image to remove any backdoors or persistent malware.
- **User training**: Reinforce the importance of only downloading trusted VMs or other training materials to avoid compromised practice environments.
